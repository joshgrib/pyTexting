# pyTexting
Sending messages to cell phones with python

##To use
###Step 1
Run niceMessages.py and friendsNumbers.py to create pickle files to save the messages as a list and the friends number as a dictionary

Note that you need to put numbers in, I can't let everyone message my friends or they wouldn't be my friends anymore

###Step 2
Run pyTexting.py and call one of the functions on a name in the numbers dictionary

spreadTheHappiness("NAME",timeDelay) will send a welcome text and then send a nice message at the frequency you determine by timeDelay, which is minutes between messages

##Step 3
Everyone is super happy
